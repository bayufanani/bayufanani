## Assalamu'alaikum wr. wb
![Hello](my_banner.png "ddd")

Proficient in fullstack PHP, a little good at Node js, and currently learning docker, scalable app and other fun stuffs i can do in my free times.  

I don't like to remembering things i think it's better if i can **understand** why i wrote that code. **I also looking  collaboration** in any fun stuff especially frontend. 😁

Anyway i am available for freelance work, building frontend, fullstack PHP anything that related to web development. I am not a senior programmer so there are still many things that i need to learn so i hope by building this resume i can step by step became senior programmer. 😁
